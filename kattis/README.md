# Interesting Problems

* phonelist: prefix matching (use sort for speed up)
* shortestpath1: basic dijkstra
* 10kindsofpeople: smart BFS (i.e. do BFS once to get all connected components)
* bank: "kinda" greedy - start from endtime to starttime using maxheap
* unionfind: basic UFDS (weighted union)
* wheresmyinternet: basic BFS connectivity
* primesieve : finding prime numbers < 10^8 quickly
* getshorty: dijkstra with negative log
* pivot: two pass from left and from right, each time keep track of current max and min
* guess: simple binary search
